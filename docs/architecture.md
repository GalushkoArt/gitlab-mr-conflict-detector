# GitLab MR Conflict Detector - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the GitLab MR Conflict Detector architecture, including component diagrams, integration points, and dependencies.

## System Architecture

The GitLab MR Conflict Detector is designed with a modular architecture following SOLID principles. The system is organized into several key components that interact to detect conflicts between merge requests in GitLab.

### High-Level Architecture

```plantuml
@startuml
package "GitLab MR Conflict Detector" {
  [CLI] --> [Core Services]
  [Core Services] --> [GitLab Integration]
  [Core Services] --> [Formatters]
  [GitLab Integration] --> [External GitLab API]
  [Core Services] --> [Security]
  [Core Services] --> [Configuration]
}
@enduml
```

The system follows a layered architecture:

1. **CLI Layer**: Handles command-line arguments and user interaction
2. **Core Services Layer**: Contains the business logic for conflict detection
3. **Integration Layer**: Manages communication with GitLab API
4. **Utility Layers**: Includes formatters, security, and configuration components

## Component Diagrams

### CLI Component

```plantuml
@startuml
package "CLI" {
  [SimpleGitLabMultiMergeRequestCommand] --> [ConflictAnalysisService]
  [SimpleGitLabMultiMergeRequestCommand] --> [InputValidator]
}
@enduml
```

The CLI component is responsible for:
- Parsing command-line arguments
- Validating user inputs
- Orchestrating the conflict detection process
- Displaying results to the user

### Core Services Component

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Core Services" {
  [ConflictAnalysisService] --> [MultiMergeRequestConflictDetector]
  [ConflictAnalysisService] --> [GitLab4JMergeRequestService]
  [ConflictAnalysisService] --> [ConflictFormatter]
  
  [MultiMergeRequestConflictDetector] --> [ConflictDetectionStrategy]
  [DefaultConflictDetectionStrategy] ..|> [ConflictDetectionStrategy]
}
@enduml
```

The Core Services component is responsible for:
- Coordinating the conflict detection workflow
- Analyzing merge requests for conflicts
- Applying conflict detection strategies
- Formatting conflict information

### GitLab Integration Component

```plantuml
@startuml
package "GitLab Integration" {
  interface "GitLabClient" as GLC
  interface "MergeRequestService" as MRS
  
  [GitLab4JClient] ..|> GLC
  [GitLab4JMergeRequestService] ..|> MRS
  
  [GitLab4JMergeRequestService] --> [GitLab4JClient]
  
  [GitLabAuthenticationClient] --> [GitLab4JClient]
  [GitLabProjectClient] --> [GitLab4JClient]
  [GitLabBranchClient] --> [GitLab4JClient]
  [GitLabMergeRequestClient] --> [GitLab4JClient]
}
@enduml
```

The GitLab Integration component is responsible for:
- Authenticating with GitLab API
- Fetching merge requests from GitLab
- Updating merge requests with conflict information
- Handling GitLab API errors and exceptions

### Formatter Component

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Formatter" {
  interface "ConflictFormatter" as CF
  
  [DefaultConflictFormatter] ..|> CF
}
@enduml
```

The Formatter component is responsible for:
- Converting conflict data into human-readable formats
- Generating formatted output for console display
- Creating formatted notes for GitLab merge requests

### Security Component

```plantuml
@startuml
package "Security" {
  [CredentialService]
  [InputValidator]
}
@enduml
```

The Security component is responsible for:
- Securely handling GitLab credentials
- Validating user inputs to prevent security vulnerabilities
- Ensuring secure communication with GitLab API

## Integration Points

### GitLab API Integration

The GitLab MR Conflict Detector integrates with the GitLab API through the GitLab4J library. The integration points include:

1. **Authentication**:
   - Personal access token authentication
   - Validation of token permissions

2. **Project Access**:
   - Verification of access to specified GitLab projects
   - Fetching project metadata

3. **Merge Request Operations**:
   - Fetching open merge requests
   - Adding comments to merge requests
   - Updating merge request labels
   - Retrieving merge request details (branches, files changed)

4. **Branch Operations**:
   - Fetching branch information
   - Comparing branches for conflicts

### Command-Line Integration

The application integrates with the command-line interface through the Picocli library, which provides:

1. **Command-Line Argument Parsing**:
   - Support for various command-line options
   - Automatic help generation
   - Type conversion and validation

2. **Exit Code Handling**:
   - Standardized exit codes for different scenarios
   - Error reporting through exit codes

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies

The GitLab MR Conflict Detector relies on the following external dependencies:

1. **GitLab4J-API**:
   - Java client library for GitLab API
   - Handles HTTP communication with GitLab
   - Provides object models for GitLab resources

2. **Picocli**:
   - Command-line parsing framework
   - Handles argument parsing and validation
   - Generates help documentation

3. **Lombok**:
   - Reduces boilerplate code
   - Provides annotations for generating getters, setters, constructors, etc.

4. **SLF4J**:
   - Logging facade
   - Provides consistent logging interface

5. **Logback**:
   - Logging implementation
   - Configurable logging backend

### Internal Dependencies

The internal components have the following dependencies:

1. **CLI depends on**:
   - Core Services
   - Security (InputValidator)

2. **Core Services depend on**:
   - GitLab Integration
   - Formatters
   - Configuration

3. **GitLab Integration depends on**:
   - External GitLab API (via GitLab4J)

4. **All components depend on**:
   - Exception handling
   - Utility classes

## Data Flow

The data flow through the system follows this pattern:

1. User provides command-line arguments (GitLab URL, token, project ID, etc.)
2. CLI component validates inputs and passes them to Core Services
3. Core Services authenticate with GitLab and fetch merge requests
4. Conflict detection is performed on the merge requests
5. Conflicts are formatted for display
6. GitLab is updated with conflict information (if requested)
7. Results are displayed to the user

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User
participant CLI
participant "Core Services" as Core
participant "GitLab Integration" as GitLab
participant "GitLab API" as API
participant "Formatter" as Formatter

User -> CLI: Command-line arguments
CLI -> CLI: Validate inputs
CLI -> Core: Process request
Core -> GitLab: Authenticate
GitLab -> API: Authentication request
API --> GitLab: Authentication response
GitLab --> Core: Authentication result
Core -> GitLab: Fetch merge requests
GitLab -> API: Get merge requests
API --> GitLab: Merge request data
GitLab --> Core: Merge request list
Core -> Core: Detect conflicts
Core -> Formatter: Format conflicts
Formatter --> Core: Formatted output
Core -> GitLab: Update with conflicts
GitLab -> API: Update merge requests
API --> GitLab: Update confirmation
GitLab --> Core: Update result
Core --> CLI: Processing result
CLI --> User: Display results

## Deployment Architecture

The GitLab MR Conflict Detector is designed to be deployed in various environments:

1. **Developer Workstation**:
   - Run directly from command line
   - Used for ad-hoc conflict detection

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Integrated into GitLab CI/CD
   - Run automatically on schedule or trigger
   - Reports conflicts as part of pipeline

3. **Server Deployment**:
   - Run as a service on a server
   - Scheduled execution
   - Centralized conflict detection for multiple projects

```plantuml
@startuml
node "Developer Workstation" {
  [GitLab MR Conflict Detector CLI]
}

node "CI/CD Pipeline" {
  [GitLab MR Conflict Detector Job]
}

node "Server" {
  [GitLab MR Conflict Detector Service]
  [Scheduler]
}

cloud "GitLab" {

IV --> CLI: Validation result
CLI -> CS: Process credentials
CS -> GAC: Secure authentication
GAC -> GAPI: HTTPS request
